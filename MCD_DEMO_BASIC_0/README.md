<h2>Let's build our own On Chip Debugger application - STEP 0 </h2>

Here the source codes related to the article: https://aurixocd.blogspot.com/2021/04/lets-build-our-own-on-chip-debugger.html

<h3> What to do</h3>

Download the sources and compile it by MS Visual Studio 2012 professional or higher. Or, just download the ZIP including the "mcd_demo_basic.exe" (in the Release directory). You will experience a basic On Chip Debugger DOS application (command line only) for AURIX.

<h3> DAS Installation Guideline</h3> 
Please be aware that you need to install DAS before being able to use the AURIX™ocd tool. Download it at https://www.infineon.com/DAS. Then you must have an AURIX™ board, as available: https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-tricore-microcontroller/?redirId=41544#!boards

I'm currently using a TC275 Lite Kit: https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_aurix_tc275_lite/
